=RCDK - The Ruby Interface for the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)

RCDK makes it possible to use the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)
from Ruby. CDK is a Java library for chemical informatics.

==Typical Usage

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'rcdk'
  require 'rcdk/util'
  
  mol = RCDK::Util::Lang.read_smiles 'c1ccccc1'
  
  puts mol.getAtomCount # =>6
  
==Downloading

Both a RubyGems installation package and a full source package
can be obtained from:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/rcdk

==Requirements

RCDK was developed with Ruby 1.8.4. Earlier versions of Ruby
may also be compatible. Ruby Java Bridge is used to interface
to the Java Virtual Machine.

==Installing

The RubyGems package can be installed using the following command
(as root):

gem install rcdk

This command will optionally install Ruby Java Bridge, if it
hasn't been installed yet.
